# Home page for pyPM.ca

The pyPM.ca population modeller was developed to study and characterize the CoViD-19 epidemic. 
The pyPM.ca suite consists of:

* pypmca: the general purpose population modelling engine
* ipypm: a graphical user interface for pypmca. Based on ipywidgets, it runs in a jupyter notebook.
* models: a repository of CoViD-19 models tuned for different regions
* data: a repository of regional CoViD-19 data on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.
