## Overview

The pyPM.ca software was developed to study and characterize
the CoViD-19 epidemic. It consists of:

* pypmca: a general purpose population modelling engine.
* ipypm: a graphical user interface for pypmca. Based on ipywidgets, it runs in a jupyter notebook.
* models: a repository of CoViD-19 models tuned for different regions.
* data: a repository of regional CoViD-19 data on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.
