## Introduction
The ipypm package uses ipywidgets to provide a graphical user interface to the pypmca modelling engine. It runs in a jupyter notebook, either on your computer (software installation required) or one of the many jupyterhub servers that available (no software installation required).

With ipypm, you can load models, explore their behaviour by adjusting parameters, load data to confront the models, and perform basic parameter estimation by fitting models to the data. The model structure itself can be edited through the GUI.

* Installation and startup
* Tabs:
  * Open and Settings: Loading models and data
  * Explore: Exploring models with data
  * Explore: Adding transitions
  * Analyze: Fitting models to data (estimating model parameters)
  * MCMC: Using MCMC methods to estimate uncertainty bands in future projections
  * Compare: Comparing two models side-by-side
  * Edit: Examining a model in detail and making changes to its structure.
* Interacting with the ipypm models and data directly in jupyter notebook cells
