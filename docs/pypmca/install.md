## [pypmca](index.md) - Installation

If you have already installed [ipypm](../../ipypm/installation.md) then you already
have the pypmca package installed.

Otherwise, you can install the pyPM.ca population modelling engine on your computer or server by:
* Ensuring that you have Python (version > 3.5)
  * If you need to install Python, consider [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) which includes Jupyter notebook
* Install pypmca software by:
  * `pip install pypmca`

It is not necessary to run pypmca inside Jupyter notebook, but it may be a convenient platform to use.
The [examples](https://github.com/pypm/pypmca/tree/master/examples/jupyter)
provided are snapshots from Jupyter notebook, but the behaviour will be the same if
using python directly.
